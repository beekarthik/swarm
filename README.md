# Animal Swarming Simulator

As part of the AR/VR development club at UC Berkeley, I am trying to help build an Augmented Reality application that allows the user to be in the middle of a group of flocking/swarming. This project is just a basic simulation in Javascript built to understand the core ideas of the flocking algorithm.

Below is a gif of the fully functioning 2D model.

Currently working extending this example to work in three dimensions so that the flocking algorithms can be directly applied into an Augmented Reality framework like Google ARCore
