# Animal Swarming Simulator

As part of the AR/VR development club at UC Berkeley, I am trying to help build an Augmented Reality application that allows the user to be in the middle of a group of flocking/swarming. This project is just a basic simulation in Javascript built to understand the core ideas of the flocking algorithm.

Below is a gif of the fully functioning 2D model.

Currently working extending this example to work in 3 dimensions so that the swarm algorithm can be directly applied into an Augmented Reality framework like Google ARCore.

The core flocking algorithm that I used was actually created by Craig Reynolds and you can read about it [here.](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)
